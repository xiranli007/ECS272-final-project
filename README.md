# Healthcare Expenditure Trends Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes global healthcare expenditure trends using three complementary visualizations: a line plot, a percentage area chart, and a scatter plot. It aims to analyze healthcare spending patterns over time, explore socio-economic factors influencing expenditure, and highlight disparities between developed and developing countries.

## Features
- **Line Plot**: Compare countriesâ€™ healthcare expenditure trends.
- **Percentage Area Chart**: Visualizes healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP for multiple countries, highlighting trends and outliers.
- **Scatter Plot**: Examines the relationship between tax revenue, public healthcare expenditure, and population size across countries.

## Research Goals
- Understand the relationship between healthcare spending, GDP per capita, and tax revenue.
- Identify differences in healthcare funding between developed and developing nations.
- Explore the impact of policy changes and global events on healthcare expenditure.

## Data Sources
Public datasets on healthcare expenditure, GDP, tax revenue, and population size from reputable sources like [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).
